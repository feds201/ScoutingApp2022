# FEDS 201 Scouting App

The following directory is the source code for the Scouting App created by the [FEDS 201](https://www.feds201.com/) FRC robotics team
out of Rochester High School.

## Description

This app is an attempt to fix a suboptimal paper-and-pencil scouting infrastructure our team had in previous years.
This app is only a part of our scouting system which includes a server to house the information 
gathered from match to match, and a main computer to display all relevant information at a glance.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Android Studio Version >= 2021.2.1
* Device with Android 11(SDK 30) or greater

### Installing

* The source app will, eventually, be found on Google Play Store for Android devices. 
* For now, download this repository and open in Android Studio. You may need to wait a little bit.
* After Android Studio has been configured, plug in a Android Device with developer mode enabled. (See [this](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-enable-developer-mode-on-android-4684044) for more info).

### Executing program
